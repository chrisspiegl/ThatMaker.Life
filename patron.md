# Together We Can Do More

The production of new episodes is an absolute passion for me and I love to do it. Yet, it also needs a lot of time, equipment, and effort to find guests, schedule conversations, do the interview, and edit all of it together so that you get a perfectly produced podcast.

With your support, it is possible for me, to invest more time into this project and for that I am incredibly grateful.
