# Uncopyright

This entire site, my[newsletter](https://chrisspiegl.com/newsletter), my[writings](https://medium.com/chrisspiegl), and most of my photographs on [Instagram](https://instagram.com/chrisspiegl) and [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/@chrisspiegl)are uncopyrighted (since January 2018).

That means I’ve put them in the public domain and released my copyright on all these works.

There is no need to email me for permission — use my content however you want! Email it, share it, reprint it with or without credit. Change it around, put in a bunch of swear words and attribute them to me. It’s OK.

Attribution is appreciated but not required.

I’d prefer people to support me and my work, but if they want to share with friends, they have every right to do so. If you’d like to[support me](https://chrisspiegl.com/patron)or tell me where you shared my work, please [contact me here](https://chrisspiegl.com/contact).

## Tip: How to Give Credit

Even though credit isn’t required, I appreciate a credit as it provides exposure to my work and encourages me to continue sharing. A credit can be as simple as adding this line below with a link to my site/profile or the original content:
